# CrashCards
CrashCards is an innovative tool designed to streamline your study process! CrashCards takes inputs in the form of images or text from notes or lecture materials and converts them into a deck containing 10 unique flashcards - containing relative questions and answers. See all your decks in a convenient view and get ready to start reviewing! It's perfect for students and professionals looking to enhance their learning efficiency and retain information more effectively. Say goodbye to the hassle of manual flashcard creation and let CrashCards do the work, so you can focus on mastering the material.

## Tech Stack

For the front end, we used **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS** with **ReactJS** and **Vite** frameworks to build the user interface and optimize our user experience.

For the backend, we chose **Django**, which allowed us to utilize **SQLite3** for our database needs. We integrated APIs like **Microsoft Azure** and **Google Gemini** to handle text recognition from images and to process text and generate flashcard content. 

**Axios** was used to facilitate communication between the Django backend and the React frontend, ensuring smooth data flow and a responsive application.
